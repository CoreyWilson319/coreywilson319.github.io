        <h1 class="title">Quotes from some of my favorite characters!</h1>
    <p id="description">I relate strongly to Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho because, like him, I had to look beyond my own family for guidance and mentorship. Yusuke’s growth comes from the people he meets along the way mentors who challenge him, shape him, and help him become his best self. That experience mirrors my own path.

Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan also reflects a part of me. His entire character is driven by doing what he believes is right, even when others don’t understand or support his choices. I see myself in that conviction—standing firm in my beliefs and acting on my own sense of purpose, even if it means going against the expectations around me.

Finally, I connect with Lelouch Lamperouge from Code Geass because of his willingness to shoulder the weight of the world for the sake of the people he loves. Lelouch’s mission to change the world so others wouldn’t suffer the way his family did resonates deeply with my own desire to break cycles, protect the people I care about, and create something better for those who come after me.

Together, these characters reflect the core parts of who I am: someone shaped by unlikely mentors, committed to doing what feels right, and driven to build a better future for the people I care about.</p>
